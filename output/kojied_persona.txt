Incredible stuff! How did you maintain character consistency? Did you generate a consistent character image and then use the image-to-video feature?

### Insight 3:
Surprised I donâ€™t see project zomboid. Graphics are retro but the game is so well made. Who knew that you needed a pipe wrench (instead of a regular wrench) to plumb the sink!

### Insight 5:
Itâ€™s pretty hard to get consistent characters when theyâ€™re photorealistic tbh. I guess our eyes are more lenient when itâ€™s cartoon.
Any tips for photo realism would be appreciated!
